# Time Converter Website

This is a time conversion tool built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It converts input in seconds into a more readable format 
(days, hours, minutes, and seconds), with an optional feature to exclude days
in the output.

It features a live clock display and utilizes *Bootstrap* for styling, 
with additional custom styles applied via the CSS file. The JavaScript 
controls the form functionality, time conversion, and clock display.

To use, simply open the HTML page in your web browser, enter the desired
number of seconds into the form, and press "Submit". Check the "Exclude days" 
box if you want the output to only include hours, minutes, and seconds.
